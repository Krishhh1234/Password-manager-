The Password Manager is a secure and efficient tool designed to help you manage and organize your passwords in one place. With features like secure password storage, password generation, and search functionality, it makes handling multiple accounts easier and safer. The application protects all stored credentials using strong encryption techniques and can only be accessed with a master password, ensuring your sensitive data remains private.

This project is built using Python and integrates libraries such as tkinter for creating the graphical user interface, sqlite3 for local database storage, and cryptography for encrypting and decrypting passwords. Upon first use, you will be prompted to set a master password, which will serve as the key to access all your stored credentials. The password manager supports adding, viewing, and generating random secure passwords for different services. Additionally, the search feature allows you to retrieve saved credentials quickly, and the copy-to-clipboard function ensures your passwords are never directly exposed on the screen.

To use the application, clone the repository and install the required packages from the requirements.txt file. Once installed, you can launch the program with a simple command (python password_manager.py) and begin managing your passwords. It is important to note that all data is stored locally in an encrypted SQLite database, and without the master password, recovery is not possible.
